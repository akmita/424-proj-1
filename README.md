# 424-proj-1

What we need to run the project:
- app.R file  
- the 11 data files (which were broken off from one massive data file)
- R studio installed on your computer
- The R programming language installed on your computer
- note: you can ignore all other R files and jupyter notebooks in this repo

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open R studio and navigate to the repository folder
3. in the top navbar click session -> set working directory -> choose directory and navigate to the project folder you downloaded
4. click file -> open and select app.R. This is the only code needed to run the visualization.
5. you will see the first 3 lines of code use 3rd party packages:
- shiny
- ggplot2
- lubridate
7. click tools -> install packages for all 3 of these
8. now you can press the green "run app" button and the visualization should start
